Some of the properties in AES cannot be proven natively by Cryptol (or at least, the proofs are slow enough that we haven't waited to see them complete). These properties are currently:
- `mixColumnsInverts`: this property shows that the `mixColumns` and `InvMixColumns` properties are each others inverse
- `aesIsCorrect`: this property shows that the AES `encrypt` and `decrypt` functions are each others inverses.

To provide a stronger assurance case, the SAW scripts in this folder prove the `aesIsCorrect` property. A side effect of this proof is a proof that `mixColumnsInverts` is also true.

If you have a [working SAW installation](https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script/), version 1.3 or later, you can get assurance of these properties:
```
