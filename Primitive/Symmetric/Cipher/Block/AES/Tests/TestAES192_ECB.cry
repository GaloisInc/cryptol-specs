/**
 * Test vectors for AES192
 * These are drawn from the NIST CAVP project.
 * In particular, these test vectors are from the `ECBVarTxt192.rsp` and
 * `ECBVarKey192.rsp` sample files.
 *
 * Note conformance to these vectors does not constitute validation by CAVP.
 * @see https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-program/block-ciphers#AES
 *
 * In ECB mode, each block of plaintext/ciphertext is encrypted/decrypted
 * independently with the same key, and there is no IV. Thus, ECB mode tests
 * are equivalent to testing the basic cipher.
