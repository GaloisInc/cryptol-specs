 * Instantiate ECDSA with curve P-521 (also known as secp521p1) and SHA3-512.
 *
 * Note that this uses `UnconstrainedSpec` because the security strength of the hash
 * function is less than that of the elliptic curve! The overall security strength
 * of this ECDSA instantiation is approximately 256 bits.
