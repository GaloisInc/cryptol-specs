# The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm

## Welcome

This document is a literate [Cryptol](https://cryptol.net/) document. This means that if you install Cryptol from the website you can run ```cryptol MD5.md``` in your terminal and all of the definitions will be typecheck, and the test cases can be run.

All text in this document is directly from the [MD5 Specification](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt).

```cryptol
module Primitive::Keyless::Hash::MD5 where
```

## 2 Terminology and Notation

In this document, a "word" is a 32-bit quantity and a "byte" is an 8-bit quantity. A sequence of bits can be interpreted in a natural manner as a sequence of bytes, where each consecutive group of eight bits is interpreted as a byte with the high-order (most significant) bit of each byte listed first. Similarly, a sequence of bytes can be interpreted as a sequence of 32-bit words, where each consecutive group of four bytes is interpreted as a word with the low-order (least significant) byte given first.

```cryptol
convert_length : [64] -> [64]
convert_length msg = join (reverse (groupBy`{8} msg))

convert : {n} (fin n) => [n*32] -> [n*32]
convert msg = join (join (map reverse msg''))
    where
        msg'  = groupBy`{8} msg
        msg'' = groupBy`{4} msg'

property test_convert_length_1 = convert_length msg == 0x0800000000000000
    where
        msg = 8 : [64]

property test_convert_initial = initialize == output
    where
        output = [0x67452301, 0xefcdab89, 0x98badcfe, 0x10325476]

property test_convert_msg = convert msg == output
    where
        msg    = 0xd98c1dd404b2008f980980e97e42f8ec
        output = 0xd41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
```

Let x_i denote "x sub i". If the subscript is an expression, we surround it in braces, as in x_{i+1}. Similarly, we use ^ for superscripts (exponentiation), so that x^i denotes x to the i-th power.

Let the symbol "+" denote addition of words (i.e., modulo-2^32 addition). Let `X <<< s` denote the 32-bit value obtained by circularly shifting (rotating) X left by s bit positions. Let `not(X)` denote the bit-wise complement of X, and let `X v Y` denote the bit-wise OR of X and Y. Let `X xor Y` denote the bit-wise XOR of X and Y, and let `XY` denote the bit-wise AND of X and Y.

## 3 MD5 Algorithm Description

We begin by supposing that we have a b-bit message as input, and that we wish to find its message digest. Here `b` is an arbitrary nonnegative integer; `b` may be zero, it need not be a multiple of eight, and it may be arbitrarily large. We imagine the bits of the message written down as follows:

```example
m_0 m_1 ... m_{b-1}
```

The following five steps are performed to compute the message digest of the message.

### 3.1 Step 1. Append Padding Bits

The message is "padded" (extended) so that its length (in bits) is congruent to 448 modulo 512. That is, the message is extended so that it is just 64 bits shy of being a multiple of 512 bits long. Padding is always performed, even if the length of the message is already congruent to 448 modulo 512.

Padding is performed as follows: a single "1" bit is appended to the message, and then "0" bits are appended so that the length in bits of the padded message becomes congruent to 448 modulo 512. In all, at least one bit and at most 512 bits are appended.

```cryptol
pad : {b, p} (fin p, p >= 0, 64 >= width b) => [b] -> [b + p + 1]
pad msg = msg # [1] # zero
```

### 3.2 Step 2. Append Length

A 64-bit representation of b (the length of the message before padding bits were added) is appended to the result of the previous step. In the unlikely event that b is greater than 2^64, then only the low-order 64 bits of b are used. (These bits are appended as two 32-bit words and appended low-order word first in accordance with the previous conventions.)

```cryptol
appendLength : {b, p} (fin p, p >= 0, 64 >= width b)
            => [b + p + 1] -> [b + p + 65]
appendLength msg = msg # b'
    where
        b' = convert_length (`b : [64])

prepMsg : {b} (64 >= width b)
       => [b] -> [((b + 65)/^ 512)][16][32]
prepMsg msg = groupBy`{16} (groupBy`{32} msgL)
    where
        type p = (b + 65) %^ 512  // how much padding is needed in addition to the [1]
        msgP   = pad`{b, p} msg
        msgL   = appendLength`{b, p} msgP
```

At this point the resulting message (after padding with bits and with b) has a length that is an exact multiple of 512 bits. Equivalently, this message has a length that is an exact multiple of 16 (32-bit) words. Let `M[0...N-1]` denote the words of the resulting message, where N is a multiple of 16.

### 3.3 Step 3. Initialize MD Buffer

A four-word buffer (A,B,C,D) is used to compute the message digest. Here each of A, B, C, D is a 32-bit register. There registers are initialized to the following values in hexadecimal, low-order bytes first:

```cryptol
type Buffer = [4][32]

initialize : Buffer
initialize = [A', B', C', D']
    where
        A = [0x01, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67]
        B = [0x89, 0xab, 0xcd, 0xef]
        C = [0xfe, 0xdc, 0xba, 0x98]
        D = [0x76, 0x54, 0x32, 0x10]
        A' = convert (join A)
        B' = convert (join B)
        C' = convert (join C)
        D' = convert (join D)
```

### 3.4 Step 4. Process Message in 16-Word Blocks

We first define four auxiliary functions that each take as input three 32-bit words and produce as output one 32-bit word.

```cryptol
F : [32] -> [32] -> [32] -> [32]
F X Y Z = (X && Y) || (~X && Z)  // XY v not(X) Z

G : [32] -> [32] -> [32] -> [32]
G X Y Z = (X && Z) || (Y && ~Z)  // XZ v Y not(Z)

H : [32] -> [32] -> [32] -> [32]
H X Y Z = X ^ Y ^ Z // X xor Y xor Z

I : [32] -> [32] -> [32] -> [32]
I X Y Z = Y ^ (X || ~Z) // Y xor (X v not(Z))
```

In each bit position F acts as a conditional: if X then Y else Z. The function F could have been defined using + instead of v since XY and not(X)Z will necer have 1's in the same bit position. It is interesting to not that if the bits of X, Y and Z are independent and unbiased, then each bit of F(X, Y, Z) will be independent and unbiased.

```cryptol
F_add : [32] -> [32] -> [32] -> [32]
F_add X Y Z = (X && Y) + (~X && Z)  // XY + not(X) Z

property f_equiv x y z = F x y z == F_add x y z
```

The functions G, H and I are similar to the function F, in that they act in "bitwise parallel" to produce their output from the bits of X, Y, and Z, in such a manner that if the corresponding bits of X, Y, and Z are independent and unbiased, then each bit of G(X,Y,Z), H(X,Y,Z), and I(X,Y,Z) will be independent and unbiased. Note that the function H is the bit-wise "xor" or "parity" function of its inputs.

This step uses a 64-element table T[1...64] constructed from the sine function. Let T[i] denote the i-th element of the table, which is equal to the integer part of `4294967296 times abs(sin(i))`, where `i` is in radians. The elements of the table are given in the appendix.

```cryptol
T : [64][32]
T =
    [0xD76AA478, 0xE8C7B756, 0x242070DB, 0xC1BDCEEE, 0xF57C0FAF,

### 3.5 Step 5. Output

The message digest produced as output is A, B, C, D. That is, we begin with the low-order byte of A, and end with the high-order byte of D.

```cryptol
md5 : {a} (64 >= width (a*8)) => [a][8] -> [128]
md5 msg = convert (join abcd)
    where
        msg' = prepMsg (join msg)
        abcd = processMsg msg'
```

This completes the description of MD5. A reference implementation in C is given in the appendix.
