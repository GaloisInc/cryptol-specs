/**
 * Tests of the SHA3_512 hash function.
 *
 * Test vectors drawn from the NIST Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program.
 * This program includes test vectors that can be used to spot-check an
 * implementation. It includes tests for bitwise inputs (where the input length
 * is any nonnegative integer) and for bytewise inputs (where the input length
 * is a multiple of 8).
 * @see CAVP. https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-program/secure-hashing#sha3vsha3vss
 * @see SHA3 bitwise test vectors. https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/sha3/sha-3bittestvectors.zip
 * @see SHA3 bytewise test vectors. https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/documents/sha3/sha-3bytetestvectors.zip
 *
 * Some of the bitwise tests in this file use the `KOP::truncate` function. The
 * CAVP vectors use the format described in [FIPS-202] Appendix B, where inputs
 * to SHA3 are provided as hex strings with an even number of digits and a
 * length parameter. The `h2b` function for processing such inputs has an
 * implicit truncation step. We've written the SHA3 spec to take arbitrary bit
 * vectors, but this assumes that the length of the input is its actual length.
 * The `truncate` function is written to support the even-hex-digit format and
 * must be called on an input before passing it to SHA3.
